# Tank-Trouble-Game
Welcome to the Tank Trouble!
This version of Tank Trouble has three players: the red player (using the awsd keys to move and the q key to shoot), the green player (using the ijkl keys to move and the u key to shoot), and the blue player (using the arrow keys to move and the space bar to shoot).
Explore the unique map generated on each level and find all 4 powerups: the railgun (red), the laser (maroon), the shotgun (gold), and the moon (gray)! But beware: rarely, a multiversal rupture causes controls to be changed. Have fun!

NOTE: This is a game I made collaboratively in a group of four in CS 3 (Software Design) at Caltech. However, due to course policy, I am not allowed to publish the physics engine we built.
